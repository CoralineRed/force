# Getting Started Guide

## Why use Force?
You might benefit from using Force if:
- Strive to follow DDD principles and use DDD patterns in your application. Force ships with built-in support for Entities, Value Objects, Specifications, and Domain Events.
- You are a fan of the Vertical Slices / CQRS architecture and/or concern-separation matters to you. Force provides you ICommand / ICommandHadler and IQuery / IQueryHandler interfaces and some extension-methods that help you to avoid writing the same boilerplate code again and again.
- Need reliable tooling for some fancy metaprogramming stuff.

## How do I use Force?
Itâ€™s simple. Just get official builds from NuGet or run the following command in the Package Manager Console: PM> Install-Package Force and may the force be with you. No additional configuration required.
